A [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com) package for maintaining a local history of files.

## Benefits

* Every time you modify a file, a copy of the old contents is kept in the local history when you:
  * open the file.
  * close the file.
  * and/or loose focus.
* Available functions are:
  * file comparison of the open file and any of its older versions from the history.
  * incremental diff view.
* Functions are available via:
  * the right-click context menu.
  * the `Local History: ...` commands from the command palette.
* `Local History` helps you out when you change or delete a file by accident.
* `Local History` can help you out when your workspace has a catastrophic problem or if you get disk errors that corrupt your workspace files.
* File revisions are stored in separate files (with full path):
	* see the [Local History path](#local-history-path) section below

### Settings

#### Default settings

```js
    "history_retention": 0, // number of days to keep files, 0 to disable deletion
    "format_timestamp": "%Y%m%d%H%M%S", // file_name-XXXXXXXX.file_extension
    "history_on_close": true, // only save LocalHistory after closing a file, not when original was saved
    "history_on_focus_lost": false,
    "history_on_load": true,
//  "history_path": "",
    "portable": true,
    "file_size_limit": 4194304 // 4 MB
```

#### Local History path

[Local History](https://github.com/vishr/local-history)'s target directory for file revisions can be set as follows:

* For `"portable": true`, [Local History](https://github.com/vishr/local-history) will save to `Sublime Text/Data/.sublime/Local History/...` wherever [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com) is installed.
* Setting `"portable": false` will change the target folder to the `~/.sublime/Local History/...` subfolder of your user directory.
  * If `"portable": false` changing `"history_path": "..."` will give you the option to change the target directory to a custom path.
